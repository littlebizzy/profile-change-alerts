Sends an email both to the WordPress admin and relevant user whenever that user updates any field on their profile (also works with WooCommerce).

* [Plugin GitHub](https://github.com/littlebizzy/profile-change-alerts)
* [SlickStack](https://slickstack.io)

#### The Long Version ####

Generates an email notice to alert the site owner (admin) and relevant user.

From the classic WP user profile, the plugin aims to detect the changes in the following fields:

- Password
- Nicename
- User email
- User URL
- User status (Multisite behaviour)
- Display name
- Roles
- Nickname
- First name
- Last name
- Biographical Info
- Visual Editor
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Admin Color Scheme
- Show front Toolbar

It is not possible to detect the avatar URL changes because it depends of the online gravatar service.

The Woocommerce fields supported are (both from admin profile page and WC frontend account pages):

- Billing First name
- Billing Last name
- Billing Company
- Billing Address line 1
- Billing Address line 2
- Billing City
- Billing Postcode / ZIP
- Billing Country
- Billing State / County
- Billing Phone
- Billing Email address

- Shipping First name
- Shipping Last name
- Shipping Company
- Shipping Address line 1
- Shipping Address line 2
- Shipping City
- Shipping Postcode / ZIP
- Shipping Country
- Shipping State / County

The email is composed from the core/email.php file, I suppose you will modify these labels. I have added different subjects for each email sended. The email message includes the user login name, a link to the admin user profile, and of course the list of changes detected.

#### Compatibility ####

This plugin has been designed for use on LEMP (Nginx) web servers with PHP 7.0 and MySQL 5.7 to achieve best performance. All of our plugins are meant for single site WordPress installations only; for both performance and security reasons, we highly recommend against using WordPress Multisite for the vast majority of projects.

#### WP Admin Notices ####

This plugin generates multiple [Admin Notices](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/admin_notices) in the WP Admin dashboard. The first is a notice that fires during plugin activation which recommends several related free plugins that we believe will enhance this plugin's features; this notice will re-appear approximately once every 6 months as our code and recommendations evolve. The second is a notice that fires a few days after plugin activation which asks for a 5-star rating of this plugin on its WordPress.org profile page. This notice will re-appear approximately once every 9 months. These notices can be dismissed by clicking the **(x)** symbol in the upper right of the notice box. These notices may annoy or confuse certain users, but are appreciated by the majority of our userbase, who understand that these notices support our free contributions to the WordPress community while providing valuable (free) recommendations for optimizing their website.

If you feel that these notices are too annoying, than we encourage you to consider one or more of our upcoming premium plugins that combine several free plugin features into a single control panel, or even consider developing your own plugins for WordPress, if supporting free plugin authors is too frustrating for you. A final alternative would be to place the defined constant mentioned below inside of your `wp-config.php` file to manually hide this plugin's nag notices:

    define('DISABLE_NAG_NOTICES', true);

Note: This defined constant will only affect the notices mentioned above, and will not affect any other notices generated by this plugin or other plugins, such as one-time notices that communicate with admin-level users.
